# A minimal GitHub Pages website

This website is generated by GitHub Pages with the absolute minimum of configuration ([View the source](https://github.com/mfisher87/simple-site)).
**You do not _need_ to know about static site generators (SSGs) like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [MySTMD](https://mystmd.org), [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to use GitHub Pages.**
Under the hood, GitHub is using Jekyll to render this site.
If you want anything more than a very simple single-page site, you might want to learn more about SSGs!
